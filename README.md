# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-2nd-Year-Project
This is my 2nd year project for my data structures and algorithms module in college. The purpose of this program is to parse a text file and add each word to an index type structure with both a definition and the list of page numbers using maps. This project was written in Java.
